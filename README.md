# Final-year-project

==> Instruction:

You have to use CV_similarity.pkl and updatedDf.pkl. Inside the app.py file I have written the whole code. I have made a get_productid_categoryid function, it will return recommended products_Id and also the product category_Id in a json format. If you want you can change function name.
